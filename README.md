# INTRODUCTION (PAGE 2)
For this project, the main goal is to develop a client-sever simulator that schedules jobs for distributed systems. The aim for this stage is to create a client-side simulator with a simple job dispatcher, which sends all jobs to the largest server type. This stage, and for the entirety of the project, is referenced accordingly to the ds-sim simulation protocol.
